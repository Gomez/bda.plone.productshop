Checking out
============

I recomment that you install bda.shoptypes to test the views

- The producview is intended as a view for a "Shop item" 
(add "Product" from bda.shoptypes to see it in action)

(add "Productgroup" and "Variation" from bda.shoptypes to see it in action)

new content is added to the DOM.

- make the quicksand view sortable on price etc.
